My name is __Jaden Hampton__, I'm a student at Montana State University currently studying Computer Science and Psychology. I am pursuing software engineering, and currently building a classic Saab 900 Turbo to be an ARA Rally Car.

------------------------------------//\\------------------------------------------


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a full-stack software for an auto glass company I currently work at.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to wrangle with Java, C, JavaScript + Typescript + React Frameworks, and R atm.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that we can both learn something from and solve a problem that makes people's lives easier.

- âš¡ About me more personally: I also have lots of hobbies in the real world. Most of my extra time is spent with my girlfriend and going outdoors with my husky puppy Mishka, or working on my cars. I am also a huge Star Trek fan, but I'm mostly just a chump for Next Gen.
