My name is __Jaden Hampton__, I'm a student at Montana State University, and currently studying Computer Science and Psychology. I am an aspiring software engineer, and currently dreaming of rallying a garage-built classic Saab 900 Turbo.

------------------------------------//\\------------------------------------------


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a full-stack software for an auto glass company I currently work at.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to wrangle with Java, C, JavaScript + Typescript + React Frameworks, and R atm.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything that we can both learn something from and solve a problem that makes people's lives easier.

- âš¡ About me more personally: I love arcade games, specifically Time Pilot atm. I also have lots of hobbies in the real world. Most of my extra time is spent with my gf being outdoors with my husky puppy Mishka, playing guitar, or working on my cars. I am also a huge Star Trek fan, but I'm mostly just a chump for Next Gen.
