__Hey! Welcome to my Github!__

My name is __Jaden Hampton__, I'm a student at Montana State University, currently majoring in Computer Science and Psychology. I am pursuing a career in software engineering and am currently building a classic Saab 900 Turbo to compete in the American Rally Association.

__What I've Been Working On__
* Inventory management software with frontend for employees and managers to interact with
* Registration system that funnels users to create an account and register for events with AuthO integration with Stripe for payment

__Some Languages I Have Worked With Recently__
* Java, C, JavaScript, React Frameworks, a lil linting in TypeScript, & R + RStudio. I would love to dive more into languages & frameworks like Ruby + Ruby on Rails, HTMX, and languages like GO and RUST to supplement my backend programming journey.

About me: I have too many hobbies, though most of my free time is spent with my girlfriend, going outdoors with my husky puppy, Mishka, or working on my cars. I'm a big Star Trek fan, and I also have a YouTube channel dedicated to making car content under the handle "jaden-hampton". I am also an ACM member through the Montana State University chapter.
