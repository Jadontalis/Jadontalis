__Hey! Welcome to my Github!__

My name is __Jaden Hampton__, I'm a student at Montana State University, currently studying Computer Science and Psychology. I am pursuing a career in software engineering and am currently building a classic Saab 900 Turbo to compete in the American Rally Association.

------------------------------------//\\------------------------------------------

* __I'm currently working on a full-stack inventory software for Summit Auto Glass in Belgrade, MT.__

* __Some languages I have delved into recently are Java, C, JavaScript, React Frameworks, a lil linting in TypeScript, & R + RStudio. I would love to dive more into languages & frameworks like Ruby + Ruby on Rails, HTMX, and languages like GO and RUST to supplement my backend programming journey.__

About me: I have too many hobbies, though of my free time is spent with my girlfriend, going outdoors with my husky puppy, Mishka, or working on my cars. I'm a big Star Trek fan, and I also have a YouTube channel dedicated to making car content under the handle "jaden-hampton".
