__Hey! Welcome to my Github!__

My name is __Jaden Hampton__, I'm a student at Montana State University, currently majoring in Computer Science and Psychology. I am pursuing a career in software engineering and am currently building a classic Saab 900 Turbo to compete in the American Rally Association.

__What I've Been Working On__
* Full-Stack inventory management software with frontend for employees to check in glass, manage part numbers and associated jobs, with a backend admin dashboards for managers to interact with database queries and process job orders.
  
* Full-stack registration web-application with frontend for end users to create an account and register for events with Square for payment processing and full backend accessing admin console for event handlers to extract data from PostgreSQL database and normalize that for run orders and internal spreadsheets.

__Some Languages & Frameworks I Have Worked With Recently__
* Java, C, JavaScript, React Frameworks, Next.js, Typescript, R & R Studio for Psychology major. I would love to dive more into languages & frameworks like Ruby + Ruby on Rails, HTMX, and languages like GO, RUST, C++, etc. to supplement my backend and low-level journey.

__About Me__
* Most of my free time is spent with my girlfriend, going outdoors with my husky puppy Mishka, or working on my cars. I'm a big Star Trek fan, and I also have a YouTube channel dedicated to making car content under the handle "jaden-hampton". I am also an ACM member through the MSU chapter.
